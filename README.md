 # üå∏ Iris Flower Classification Project: KNN vs. Logistic Regression
 This project is a foundational machine learning exercise focusing on the classification of the classic Iris dataset.
 We train and critically compare two primary classification algorithms: a linear model and a distance-based model.
# üéØ Project Goals
To master essential data preparation techniques like Feature Scaling.

To build and optimize the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier.

To train and interpret the Multinomial Logistic Regression model.

To perform a comparison and critical analysis of both models 
# üóÇÔ∏è Dataset : Iris dataset

# üõ†Ô∏è Methodology and Steps
 # 1-Data Preparation
 The Iris dataset is loaded and split into $80\%$ training and $20\%$ testing sets
 
# 2-Feature Scaling:
is applied using StandardScaler.(Reflection: The importance of scaling for distance-based algorithms like KNN is highlighted).

# 3- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models :
are trained across various $K$ values ($1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 20$).
The optimal $K$ value (which achieved $100\%$ accuracy in our run) is identified.
A plot of Accuracy vs. $K$ is generated for visual analysis.

# 4- Logistic Regression :
A Multinomial Logistic Regression model is trained ($\max\_iter=1000$).
The model's Coefficients are printed and interpreted to assess feature importance (e.g., how petal length influences classification).

# 5- Model ComparisonPerformance
is compared using the Classification Report (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
 Confusion Matrices are generated to visualize specific error types for each model.
(Reflection: The analysis focuses on why a simpler model (Logistic Regression) or a more complex one (KNN) might perform better)

# üí≠ Key Theoretical Focus
This project serves as an application of several critical ML concepts:
Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Discussing how the choice of $K$ in KNN affects the model's tendency towards Underfitting (High Bias) or Overfitting (High Variance)
Model Interpretability: Understanding what the coefficients in Logistic Regression tell us about the underlying data structure.
Model Suitability: Analyzing when to prefer a simple, interpretable model (Logistic Regression) over a more flexible, non-linear one (KNN).
